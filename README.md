# PHPLaravelDeveloppoOndemandBE
I'm building a copyright-expired on-demand movie platform. The main hurdle was updating my old Laravel 8 project to version 10, implementing JWT token authentication. The project features a mix of English and Italian variables due to a previous pluralization issue in Laravel 8 that has been resolved in version 10.
